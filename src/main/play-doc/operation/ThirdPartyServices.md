# Third-Party Services

ConductR's method of delivering third-party service support embraces the [Open Container Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/) specifications. A vendor simply needs to provide a Docker or OCI image and ConductR can then take care of deploying and scaling it across your cluster.

We've spent a lot of effort ensuring that essential services will work correctly in a ConductR cluster. Below, you'll find a curated list of common applications and the required arguments to load them into your cluster. This is especially useful for getting started quickly during development as installing these services is often not trivial.

Note that operating these services in production requires a lot of domain-specific knowledge. As such, we recommend you weigh the benefits of managing them yourself with ConductR versus using a hosted solution in combination with ConductR's [external service support](ExternalServices).

#### Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is a search and analytics engine. The example below deploys [elastic](https://www.elastic.co/)'s image into your ConductR cluster. For more information on this image and its arguments, refer to [Install Elasticsearch with Docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html).


```bash
conduct load docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.4.0 \
    --start-command '[
        "bin/elasticsearch", 
        "-Enetwork.bind_host=$ELASTICSEARCH_TCP_9200_BIND_IP", 
        "-Ehttp.port=$ELASTICSEARCH_TCP_9200_BIND_PORT", 
        "-Enetwork.publish_host=$BUNDLE_HOST_IP", 
        "-Expack.security.enabled=false", 
        "-Ecluster.name=conductr"
    ]' \
    --volume es-data=/usr/share/elasticsearch/data \
    --endpoint elasticsearch-tcp-9200 \
        --service-name elastic-search \
        --bind-port 0 \
        --bind-protocol http
```

#### Kafka

[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed streaming platform that can be used to publish, subscribe, and process streams of data in real-time. The example below deploys [Confluent, Inc](https://www.confluent.io/)'s Kafka image into your ConductR cluster. For more information on this image and its arguments, refer to [Confluent's Documentation](http://docs.confluent.io/current/cp-docker-images/docs/configuration.html#confluent-kafka-cp-kafka).

*Please note that Kafka relies on [ZooKeeper](#ZooKeeper) for coordination. Ensure that it is available in your ConductR cluster via the service name `zookeeper`.*  

```bash
conduct load confluentinc/cp-kafka \
    --endpoint cp-kafka-tcp-9092 \
        --service-name kafka \
        --bind-port 0 \
    --volume kafka-data=/var/lib/kafka/data \
    --volume kafka-secrets=/etc/kafka/secrets \
    --env 'KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://$CP_KAFKA_TCP_9092_BIND_IP:$CP_KAFKA_TCP_9092_BIND_PORT' \
    --env 'KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w %{redirect_url} $SERVICE_LOCATOR/zookeeper | sed s@^tcp://@@)'
```

#### MySQL

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). The example below deploys the MySQL team's image to your ConductR cluster. For more information on this image and its arguments, refer to [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) on Docker Hub.
 
```bash
conduct load mysql:5.7 \
    --endpoint mysql-tcp-3306 \
        --service-name mysql \
        --bind-port 3306 \
    --volume mysql-data=/var/lib/mysql \
    --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw
 ```

#### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). The example below deploys the PostgreSQL community's image into your ConductR cluster. For more information on this image and its arguments, refer to [PostgreSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) on Docker Hub.

```bash
conduct load postgres:9.6.3 \
    --endpoint postgres-tcp-5432 \
        --service-name postgres \
        --bind-port 5432 \
    --volume postgres-data=/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
```

#### ZooKeeper

[ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) is a distributed coordination service. The example below deploys [Confluent, Inc](https://www.confluent.io/)'s ZooKeeper image into your ConductR cluster. For more information on this image and its arguments, refer to [Confluent's Documentation](http://docs.confluent.io/current/cp-docker-images/docs/quickstart.html#zookeeper).
 
```bash
conduct load confluentinc/cp-zookeeper \
    --endpoint cp-zookeeper-tcp-2181 \
        --service-name zookeeper \
        --bind-port 0 \
    --volume zookeeper-data=/var/lib/zookeeper/data \
    --volume zookeeper-secrets=/etc/zookeeper/secrets \
    --volume zookeeper-log=/var/lib/zookeeper/log \
    --env 'ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT=$CP_ZOOKEEPER_TCP_2181_BIND_PORT'
 ```
